Techlog


Techlog is an online based UAV log/Personnel management tool 


Aim is to build an easy to use platform that will allow UAV owners and operators to file and store information on employees using their 
UAVs. 

The app will allow for the assignment of responsibilities such as Unit commander, technician etc within a unit, all created within the application.

The app will also feature an online viewing tool for .kmz dumps and, eventually, an online .log analyzing tool.


The application is built on top of the cakephp framework
